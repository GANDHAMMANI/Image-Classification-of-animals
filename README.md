# 🐾 Image Classification: Dogs, Cats & Snakes  

This repository contains a project focused on classifying images of dogs, cats, and snakes using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project integrates **MobileNetV3-Large** and **ResNet-152** architectures for feature extraction and classification, with an interactive **Streamlit** app for real-time predictions.

## 📋 Project Overview  

This project tackles the challenge of classifying images into three categories:  
1. **Dogs**  
2. **Cats**  
3. **Snakes**  

### Key Features:  
- **Custom CNN Model**: A baseline model developed using CNN layers.  
- **Pretrained Models**: Leveraging the power of **MobileNetV3-Large** and **ResNet-152** for transfer learning.  
- **Streamlit App**: A user-friendly interface for uploading images and getting predictions instantly.
